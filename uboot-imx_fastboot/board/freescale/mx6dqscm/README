How to use U-Boot on Freescale MX6DQSCM boards
----------------------------------------------

- Build U-Boot for MX6DQSCM QWKS rev3 board*:

$ make mx6dqscm_1gb_fix_qwks_rev3_defconfig
$ make

This will generate the u-boot image u-boot.imx.

- Flash the u-boot image into the micro SD card:

sudo dd if=u-boot.imx of=/dev/sdX bs=1k seek=1; sync

*Other defconfigs availabe are:
    mx6dqscm_1gb_fix_qwks_rev3_defconfig
    mx6dqscm_1gb_fix_qwks_rev3_spinor_defconfig
    mx6dqscm_1gb_interleaving_qwks_rev3_android_defconfig
